Today, I went to the  with my friend <person_name>. We saw a <animal_name>  jumping on a <noun> ! It looked at us and said, “<silly_phrase>!”

We were so <emotion> that we ran and hid behind a <object> . Then, <person_name> pulled out a <object> and we escaped on a <objec>.

It was the most <adjective> day ever!
